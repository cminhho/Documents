What is the DOME?
> DOM-Document Object Model is an API(Application Programing Interface) for VALID HTML and WELL-FORMAT XML document
> DOM defines the logical structure of document and the way a document is accessed and manipulatin  

What is the HTML5
> HTML5 is a fifth reversion of HTML
> HTML added many interesting features which the old versions don't have them:
	+ New element, Attribute(tags, input type)
	+ Full CSS3 support.
	+ Video and Audio (Multimedia)
	+ 2D  and 3D graphics.
	+ Local storage + Local SQL query
	+ Web applications
	+ Sementic tag

DocType declaration in HTML5
> HTML5 only use one simple tag to declare DOCTYPE: <!DOCTYPE html>	

Disadvantages when we use HTML5
> HTML5 is still a work in progress.
> HTML is only yet an official standard. No browsers have full HTML5 support.

Some new input types:
> color/date/datetime/email/month/number/range/search/tel/time/url/week
> Select your favorite color: <input type="color" name="favorite">

HTML5 multimedia support
> we can use <audio> and <video> tag
	<video width="320" height="320" controls>
		<source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		<source src="movie.org" type="video/org">
		<source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm">
	</video>
	problems:
		+ You must convert your videos to many different formats.
		+ The <video> element does not work in older brosers.
		
Can you give something graphical feature?
> With HTML5, we can draw the graphics easier than ever. HTML5 supports canvas and SVG for drawing:
	- Canvas
		+ The HTML5 <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting
		+ The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics
		
		+ Examples to create a canvas:
			Defines canvas:
				<canvas id="myCanvas" width="320" height="320" style="border: 1px solid #000000"/>
			Use script to draw graphic to canvas
				<scipt>
					var c = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
					var ctx = c.getContext('2d');
					ctx.fillStyle = '#FF0000';
					ctx.fillRect(0,0,150,75);
				</scipt>
	- SVG advandtages
		+ Advandtages of using SVG over other image formats(like JPEG and GIF) are:
			++ SVG images can be created and edited any text editor
			
Local storege
> With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user's browsers
	+ As we know, earlier, this feature was done by cookies
	+ However, web storage with HTML5 has more secure and faster
